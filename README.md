# Artificial Intelligence - Exercise 1: Patrolling and Wander

## Proposed Activity:

### Create a scene with two agents

- The first one should use a patrolling movement using waypoints and the ghost smoothing technique. The initial point and direction should be randomly selected.
- The second one should move using a wandering movement.
